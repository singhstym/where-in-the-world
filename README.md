# Where in the World

### Hi there!  ðŸ‘‹

I created this project to practice React and working with APIs in JavaScript. This project uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) to get countries information. The project has been created by using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's still a work in progress and I will probably add some more features and animations down the line.

To run this project locally:

1.  You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
2.  Clone this repository.
  ```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:styamsingh/where-in-the-world.git
  ```
3.  Install the dependencies from within the project's directory.
  ```bash
  $ npm install
  ```
4.  Start the project.
  ```bash
  $ npm start
  ```
